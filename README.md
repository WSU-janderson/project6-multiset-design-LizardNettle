# Project 6 - MultiSet Design
The project descriptinon is in the [PDF](MultiSet_Fall25.pdf) located in this repo.

- The one formulated within MS Word is located in the file "DSA-6-MultisetDesignDoc-ZanderLittle.docx" and the pdf is located at "multiset-design.pdf." 

- The .md version is located at "Multiset-design.md" and the pdf is located at "multiset-design-md.pdf"
